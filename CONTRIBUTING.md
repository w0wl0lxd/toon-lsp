# Contributing to toon-lsp

Thank you for your interest in contributing to toon-lsp!

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO.txt) (DCO) to ensure that all contributions can be legally incorporated into the project under its dual license (AGPL-3.0-only + Commercial).

### What is DCO?

The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they have the right to submit their contribution. It was created by the Linux Foundation and is used by many open source projects.

### How to Sign Off

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message:

```
feat(parser): Add support for nested arrays

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

You can add this automatically by using the `-s` flag with `git commit`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(parser): Add support for nested arrays"
```

### Why DCO?

Because toon-lsp is dual-licensed (AGPL-3.0-only for open source, commercial for proprietary use), we need to ensure that all contributions can be distributed under both licenses. The DCO provides a simple, legally-binding way for contributors to certify they have this right.
