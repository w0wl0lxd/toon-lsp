## Dual Licensing

toon-lsp is available under two licensing options:

### 1. Open Source License (AGPL-3.0-only)

For open source projects and individual developers, toon-lsp is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).

**You can use AGPL-3.0 if:**
- You're using it locally for personal/internal development
- Your project is also open source under an AGPL-compatible license

### 2. Commercial License

For organizations that cannot comply with AGPL terms, commercial licenses are available.

- Your legal team prohibits AGPL dependencies
- You want to avoid copyleft source disclosure requirements

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this in my company's internal tools?**
A: Yes, internal use without distribution doesn't trigger AGPL.

A: If your extension is open source (AGPL-compatible), no. If proprietary, yes.
